# NBA-allstar-project 
This is a project to predict the probability of a college player receiving an NBA all-star selection based solely on their college stats. College and nba data scraped from sports-reference and basketball-reference.com, respectively. The data is then run through some classification models (will be adding more) and evaluated with accuracy and AUC (ROC curve) scores. This was done mostly for fun, marrying my passion for the NBA and sports with my passion for machine learning and statistics.
